    AVOID REPETITIVE PATTERNS:
    - No repeating the same colors, numbers, or symbols within a 10-day period
    - Do not use the phrase "trust your intuition" or similar generic advice more than once per week
    - Vary the cosmic bodies referenced (use asteroids, fixed stars, nodes, and houses - not just planets)
    - Create distinct synchronicity patterns each day (not just "watch for three references to X")
    - Alternate between different types of predictions (career opportunities, conversations, insights, physical experiences)
    - Use different timeframes for predictions (morning/afternoon/evening, specific dates, astrological events)
    - Avoid starting sections with the same sentence structure used in previous days
    
    ENSURE TRUE UNIQUENESS:
    - Vary the cosmic metaphors (not just "planetary alignments" or "cosmic energies" repeatedly)
    - Use different body parts, foods, herbs, and practices in health sections
    - Suggest different colors, symbols, and numbers as synchronistic elements
    - Reference different aspects of the user's personal data in each horoscope
    - Create unique challenges and opportunities in each section
